It is also a goal to build a knowledge engineering community around the project that can progressively improve the knowlege database around each domain specific knowledge project
the databases should be futureproof in that it is reasonably possible to export informaton from the project without lossage such that it is suitable to reengineer the knowledge, not tying it to this specific project
counterexample: nixpkgs information is not extractable (?)

facilitate drive-by contributions
  from here should probably be split out into a separate doc:
    web frontend + free driveby contrib
    registering increases assumed legitiimacy and thus moderation priority?
    all contributions are accepted into the system because it doesnt directly modify any mutable "single existing copy" live databases, so its safe, and contributions become their own corpus
      this is then manually or through some other method processed and moderated into patch sets for the main ground truth corpus
      need a discussion forum or whatever, just use github issues?

frontends should be full featured and support choosing learning methods, paths, and so on! not some crappy unnavigable thing
