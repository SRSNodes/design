looking for people to consult in the following domains:

someone knowledgeable in computational linguistics, preferably japanese:

someone knowledgeable in ITS/language systems, and or knowledge representation in that domain
  why?/ what do i want to ask?: TODO
someone for srs? (skeptics welcome)
  my personal opinion without a much research currently is that srs is simple the logical consequence of managing information at volume
  why?/ what do i want to ask?: TODO

talk to some "good" teacher / cognitive psychologist / ??? whether any of this makes didactic sense?

user studies?
  note: for starters i should probably just get this to work for myself
